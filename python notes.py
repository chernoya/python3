# STUFF TO FIGURE OUT:
# Functions 
# Methods
# User input + Reading files

# Object-oriented programming (Polymorphism, Data Abstraction, Dunder Methods, and Encapsulation)
# Comprehension 
# Lambda functions
# Algorithms and Data structures
# Environments

# GOALS:
# Start other projects / games
# Grasp basics / fundamentals of Linux

# DATA STRUCTURES:

name = 'Chetan' # String
age = 16        # Integer
gpa = 9.7       # Float
lovesPython = True    # Boolean
friends = ['Jack', 'Malik', 'Robin']  # Array/List
details = {'color': 'white', 'height': '5 feet'} #Dictionary

# EXTRA MATH OPERATORS 

(7 // 2) = 3   # Integer division (or quotient)
(11 % 3) = 2   # Remainder
(3 ** 4) = 81  # raised to the power
